HTML is a markdown language, meaning it is a way to format text for a computer
HTML uses tags, notated by the <...>
HTML is what is used to create every single website
At the to, you can see a DOCTYPE html tag, that tells us this is html5
    Almost all website and games use HTML5 

The <head> tag describing the metadata of a site
-metadata basicly means information about the site, not the site itself

The <body> tag is most of the website itself

The <h#> tags stand for headers
Put text between the tags to put it on the website
As the # in the header tags gets larger, the text gets smaller

The <p> is just a paragraph
<br> creates a new line

images are made with <img src="url">
You can change the width of an image by adding: width=100 height=100
    ex: <img src="url" width=50 height=100>
If you put a number, it will assume it will be that many pixels long/tall
If you put a percentage, it will take up that percentage of the screen
